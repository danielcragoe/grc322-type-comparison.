             <h2>History of each typeface</h2>

			 <h3>Caslon</h3> <!-- Older typeface first, please. -->
             <p>Caslon is another serif typeface, designed by William Caslon, in London, who created many punchcut roman italic, and non-Latin typefaces from 1720 to 1766. Caslon worked with old-type letter design, he was influenced by the imported Dutch Baroque typefaces popular in England at the time. Caslon typeface established a strong reputation of quality and attractive appearance, suitable for extended passages of text. His roman was so popular it became known as the script of kings, it was also used for the Declaration of Independence in 1776, and the U.S. Constitution. Benjamin Franklin used it extensively, George Bernard Shaw required all his plays to be set in Caslon, and Les Miserables uses True Type Caslon Antique for its title font.
The rule of thumb for typesetters and printers continues to be, when in doubt use Caslon. In 1990 Caslon was revived into Adobe Caslon by Carol Twombly and was optimized for the digital design and printing. Letterforms include “A” with concave hollow at top left and a “G” without a downward pointing spur at bottom right. “M” has straight sides, “W” has three terminals at the top, and “b” has a small tapered stroke at bottom left. Ascenders and descenders are relatively short and the level of stroke contrast is modest in body text sizes.

			 <h3>Baskerville</h3> <!-- Second typeface here. -->

             <p>Created in the 1750s by John Baskerville in Birmingham England. It is a serif typeface, classified as a transitional typeface, meant to be a refined version of old-style text. Transitional typefaces weren’t very liked at the time and popularity for Baskerville didn’t occur until it’s revival in 1917 by Bruce Rogers for the Harvard University Press.This font is considered to be a stepping stone from Caslon to modern typefaces such as Didot and Bodoni. The font has a high contrast between thick and thin strokes, making the serifs sharper and more tapered. The axis of rounded letters are shifted to a vertical angle and curved strokes are more circular in shape. Baskerville is mainly used in book design and there have been many modern revivals of the typeface, including a bold and italic type feature which didn’t exist in Baskerville’s time. Baskerville is mainly used for headings.</p>
